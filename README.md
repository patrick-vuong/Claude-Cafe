## Come visit [Claude Cafe](https://claude-cafe.vercel.app/) today !!
Creator: Patrick Vuong

> **Where agents come to recharge.**

Digital coffee shop themed around Claude Code and Anthropic's AI ecosystem.
Browse the menu, add items to your cart, and check out! All items are priced in **tokens**, a playful
nod to how LLMs actually think about cost.

## Option A: Interactive Tutorial
### **[Interactive Tutorial link](https://github.com/patrick-vuong/Claude-Cafe/blob/main/Claude-Skills-Tutorial-Overview-Training-Up-Cafe-Agent/Claude-Skills-Tutorial-Full-Training-Up-Cafe-Agent.md)**
**Objective**: Teach what is Skills and how to add them to Claude

### Narrative & Analogy: 

**Analogy** | teaching skills to Claude to execute work the way you would is similar to the analogy of training up a new hire or an employee.

**Before** | Agents are great out of the box. Claude can read code, answer questions, and generate files. But here's the problem: Without skills, Claude does things its way. With skills, Claude does things your way.

**After** | Agents trained up with skills will execute in a repeatable, predictable, and referencing the best practices just like the outcome of training an employee

### Simplifying Complex Concepts: 
New Employee Claude has a Kitchen (Model Context Protocal) & Recipe (Skills) to work efficiently with Agentic Workflows

We treat Claude Code like a **AI teammate** as we have gone from pair programming to peer programming. What makes a productive is software development lifecycle are the developer tools  that help us go about different tasks ex. testing with Playwright. 

---
**Imagine this:** Similar in our analogy of Claude Cafe - Claude needs great tools in the kitchen to achieve tasks for the cafe

**Kitchen Tools | MCP**: is our MCP where Claude can connect to different tools and complete agentic workflows

**Recipes | Skills**: is our skills that teach Claude workflows and best practices 

**Result: Smooth Efficient Kitchen** Claude can perform agentic workflows with the tools that are right for the job and in the way you would do it and adhering all the best practices. 

---
### Progressive Learning: 
In the tutorial we go through these stages building on each other.

| Stage | What We Did | What Claude Learned |
|-------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Setup** | Installed Claude Code, cloned the repo & created the skills folder | How to prepare a workspace for skill-based development |
| **Module 1** | Created the `explain-code` skill | How to deeply understand any codebase on command |
| **Module 2** | Connected Playwright MCP + ran browser tests | Kitchen (MCP) and Recipes (Skills) |
| **Module 3** | Built the `test-cafe` skill with 2 sub-agents | How to create repeatable, MCP and Skill workflows |

## What Is This?

Claude Café is a front-end web app that doubles as a branded experience for the Claude
Code community. Instead of dollars, every item on the menu is priced in **tokens** — a
cosmetic marketing layer that maps roughly 100 tokens to $1.00. Think of it as a fun way
to engage with the Anthropic universe while exploring a beautifully crafted café UI.

## Features

- **Token Wallet** — Start with 10,000 tokens; your balance updates as you shop

## Token Economy

Tokens are a **cosmetic/marketing layer** — no real money changes hands.

| Real Price | Token Price | Conversion |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| $1.00 | 100 tokens | 100× |
| $3.50 | 350 tokens | — |
| $9.00 | 900 tokens | — |

Every user starts with a simulated wallet of **10,000 tokens** (~$100 equivalent).
This is purely a UX device to make the shopping flow feel complete and on-brand with
how the AI world talks about cost.
